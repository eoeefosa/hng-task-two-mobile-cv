## Task: Mobile CV Application

**Objective**: Develop and design a mobile application serving as a comprehensive CV, showcasing personal and professional details. The app should enable both viewing and editing of the provided CV information.

### Requirements:

#### Personal Information:
The application should display:

1. Your full name
2. Slack username
3. GitHub handle
4. A brief personal bio

#### Home/First Page (CV View):
This will be the initial screen users encounter upon opening the app. It will come pre-filled with your aforementioned details. Craft this page in a clean and organized manner to present the CV information clearly.

#### Editing Capability:
Include a dedicated page or screen for editing the CV particulars. This editing page should offer user-friendly fields or sections for modifying the existing CV data.

#### Real-time Updates:
After making changes to the CV details, returning to the home/first page should immediately reflect the alterations. Ensure the app updates dynamically without requiring manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Legibility: All content within the application, particularly on the home/first page, must be legible, easy to read, and well-structured.
- Multi-screen Application: The application should encompass at least two distinct screens or pages - the primary CV viewing page and the editing page.
- No Third-party Dependencies: Develop the application exclusively using the native capabilities of the mobile platform, without integrating any third-party tools, packages, plugins, or libraries.
- Documentation: Incorporate a README.md file in your repository, providing clear setup instructions, an overview of the application, its functionalities, and any other pertinent details.
